We keep here the code for the model and simulations used to determine and optimize the COVID-19 testing strategies at the Tokyo and Beijing Olympics.

Files are named descriptively based on the scenario they simulate.

The files in this folder should be run one directory up -- that is in the main repository directory, or with access to the Data directory at the same working level.

For full details, see our manuscript ---.
